-- 1. Typeclass inheritance is when a typeclass has a superclass. This is
-- a way of expressing that a typeclass requires another typeclass to
-- be available for a given type before you can write an instance.
-- class Num a => Fractional a where
-- (/) :: a -> a -> a
-- recip :: a -> a
-- fromRational :: Rational -> a
-- Here the typeclass Fractional inherits from Num. We could also
-- say that Num is a superclass of Fractional. The long and short of
-- it is that if you want to write an instance of Fractional for some ùëé,
-- that type ùëé, must already have an instance of Num before you
-- may do so.
-- -- Even though in principle
-- -- this could work, it will fail because
-- -- Nada doesn't have a Num instance
-- newtype Nada = Nada Double deriving (Eq, Show)
-- instance Fractional Nada where
-- (Nada x) / (Nada y) = Nada (x / y)
-- recip (Nada n) = Nada (recip n)
-- fromRational r = Nada (fromRational r)
-- Then if you try to load it:
-- No instance for (Num Nada)
-- arising from the superclasses
-- of an instance declaration
-- In the instance declaration for
-- ‚ÄòFractional Nada‚Äô
-- You need a Num instance first. Can‚Äôt write one that makes sense?
-- Then you‚Äôre not allowed to have a Fractional instance either.
-- Them‚Äôs the rules.



-- 2. Side effects are how we refer to observable actions programs may
-- take other than compute a value. If a function modifies some
-- state or interacts with the outside world in a manner that can be
-- observed, then we say it has an effect on the world.


-- 3. IO is the type for values whose evaluation bears the possibility
-- of causing side effects, such as printing text, reading text input
-- from the user, reading or writing files, or connecting to remote
-- computers. This will be explained in much more depth in the
-- chapter on IO.


-- 4. An instance is the definition of how a typeclass should work for
-- a given type. Instances are unique for a given combination of
-- typeclass and type.


-- 5. In Haskell we have derived instances so that obvious or common
-- typeclasses, such as Eq, Enum, Ord, and Show can have the
-- instances generated based only on how the datatype is defined.
-- This is so programmers can make use of these conveniences
-- without writing the code themselves, over and over.
