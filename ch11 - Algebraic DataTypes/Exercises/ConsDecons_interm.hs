-- True

-- Since
-- Programmer is a product of OperatingSystem and Program-
-- mingLanguage , you can determine how many inhabitants of Program-
-- mer you have by calculating:
-- length allOperatingSystems * length allLanguages
-- This is the essence of how product types and the number of inhabitants
-- relate.
-- If after running nub from Data.List to remove duplicate values over
-- your allProgrammers value, it equals the number returned by multi-
-- plying those lengths together, youâ€™ve probably got it figured out. Try
-- to be clever and make it work without manually typing out the values.
