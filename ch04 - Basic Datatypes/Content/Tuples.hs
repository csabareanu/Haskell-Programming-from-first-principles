-- allows to store and pass multiple values within a single value
-- DEF. The arity of a tuple is the number of elements within a tuple.

-- The two-tuple has in Haskell some default convenience functions for getting the first and second value.
-- fst :: (a,b) -> a
-- snd :: (a,b) -> b
-- OBS. a and b can be of different types. Ex. (Int, String)

--------------------
-- LISTS
--------------------
-- another type used to store multiple values withing a single value
-- all constituents must be of the same type
-- lists have their own syntax [] and it is used for both the type constructor in type signatures and at the term level to express list values.
-- the number of constituents within a list can change as you operate on the list . The arity of tuples is immutable.
